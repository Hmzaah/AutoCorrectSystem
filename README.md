# AutoCorrector using NLP

This repository contains an AutoCorrector feature implemented in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The AutoCorrector can suggest corrections for misspelled words based on a corpus of text data.

## Features

- Detects misspelled words in a text.
- Suggests corrections for misspelled words using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
- Utilizes a frequency-based approach to suggest the most likely correct word.
- Can be easily integrated into other Python applications or NLP pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text processing and tokenization.
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Algorithm to find the closest match for a misspelled word.

## How It Works

1. **Corpus Building**: The application builds a vocabulary from a given text corpus. The more extensive the corpus, the better the suggestions.
2. **Error Detection**: It checks for misspelled words by comparing them to the words in the vocabulary.
3. **Correction**: Using the Levenshtein distance, it finds the closest matching word from the corpus and suggests the correct word.
4. **Frequency-Based Suggestion**: If multiple suggestions are found, the most frequent word is suggested.
